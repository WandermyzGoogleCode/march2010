They way to add a virtual partition in the file system.


= Details =

 * Add a virtual partition with default size.(The default value should be half of the entire physical memory. I think it's enough.)
{{{
tmpfs /media/ramdisk tmpfs defaults,noatime,mode=1777 0 0
}}}
 * I don't know how to specific the partitions size currently...
 * The performance of the ramdisk partition is pretty good. Copying a 200MB file in hard disk spends about 8sec, but by ramdisk it spends no time.
